# LSB-Image-Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another medium like an image, audio, video, or text. In this project, I implemented Digital Image Steganography using the LSB technique, where changes to the lowest bit of each color component (R, G, B) are visually almost undetectable.
